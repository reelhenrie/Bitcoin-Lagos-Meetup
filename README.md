- Ensure that any food is ordered and timing is agreed upon.
- Check the venue to make sure the room is as required and toilets are okay.

Overview of Meetup:

These meetups provide an opportunity to learn about Bitcoin from individuals who have been studying it for many years and transact with Bitcoin (BTC) on a daily basis, both locally and globally. The goal of this group is to foster greater adoption in Lagos,Nigeria among merchants and encourage the development of circular economies. Please note that this meetup is not meant to provide financial or investment advice. It is for informational and entertainment purposes only. No purchase is necessary, and we will not ask for any personal data unless you make an inquiry and request that we get back to you after the event. Always conduct your research to verify any information you receive from us, as we might be mistaken or operating under incorrect assumptions ourselves!

OGs and Newbies:

- Satoshi: For a bit of fun and to get everyone warmed up and introduced, we'll just have a bit of fun with these segments, but if you don't want to say anything, that is fine because, like all things bitcoin, it is 100% voluntary and optional!
